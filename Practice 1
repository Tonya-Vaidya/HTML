        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is my first attempt at HTML since the days of Myspace.</p>
        <p>HTML is a<strong>simple</strong> yet effective coding language.</p><br>
  <h2>Let's review some basic rules.</h2>
        
         <p style="font-size: 20; color: #20B2AA">Using left and right angeled brackets, tags are used to identify what item is being changed. This sentence uses the font "Verdana" in "Light Sea Green" or #20B2AA.</p>
         
<p style="font-family:'Garamond'">This is the font "Garamond", which is my <em>favorite</em> font.</p> 
<p>I'm practicing HTML and Python from <time>11:00</time>a.m. to <time>1:00</time>p.m. every day. By adding in time in tag format, the code can have machine interaction which allows for auto changes or reminders.</p>
